## 🔴 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Finding 1: Engine Has Stub Implementations
The `recursive_dmaic_engine_v2.py` has **STUB IMPLEMENTATIONS** for Phases 3-5:
- Phase 3: Only counts duplicates (~50 lines) vs. comprehensive analysis (180 lines)
- Phase 4: Returns placeholder message (~10 lines) vs. action plans (220 lines)
- Phase 5: Basic controls (~35 lines) vs. comprehensive framework (260 lines)

### Finding 2: Comprehensive Logic Exists Separately
Full implementations exist in standalone runners:
- `run_phase3_analyze.py` - 4 complexity categories, 6 issue types, 4 opportunities
- `run_phase4_improve.py` - Action plans, effort estimation, priority recommendations
- `run_phase5_control.py` - 5 controls, monitoring plan, roadmap, success criteria

### Finding 3: Runtime Tracking Not Integrated
`runtime_dependency_tracker.py` (150 lines) is ready but not integrated into Phase 2B execution.

### Finding 4: Phase 2B Path Bug
Path doubling bug causing 99.7% of execution failures (6,982 files).

### Finding 5: Knowledge Dilution Risk
If we proceed without integration, we risk losing all the comprehensive logic in the standalone runners.

- Import `runtime_dependency_tracker` in engine
- Wrap Phase 2B execution with tracker
- Merge runtime dependencies into Phase 3 analysis
- Test dependency capture

### Priority 3: Fix Phase 2B Path Bug
**Effort:** 3 hours (Day 2)
- Locate path doubling logic
