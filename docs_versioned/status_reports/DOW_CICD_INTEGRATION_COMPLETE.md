## 📈 Expected Outcomes

### CI Pipeline
- **Execution Time**: ~10-15 minutes
- **Coverage**: Ubuntu + RHEL 8 + RHEL 9
- **Quality Gates**: Linting, testing, smoke tests, integration tests

### CD Pipeline
- **Execution Time**: ~20-25 minutes
- **Validation**: Multi-platform CI + DMAIC full cycle
- **Artifacts**: PDF, GLOOB bundles, universal archives
- **Release**: Automated GitHub Release with all artifacts

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Integration Approach
1. **Backup First**: Always archive existing workflows
2. **Merge Features**: Combine best of both systems
3. **Maintain Compatibility**: Keep all existing features
4. **Add Value**: Enhance with new capabilities
5. **Document Everything**: Comprehensive documentation is critical

### Technical Decisions
1. **Python 3.11**: Standardized on 3.11 for compatibility
2. **Gated Deployment**: All CI must pass before CD
3. **Optional RHEL**: RHEL jobs skip if runners unavailable
4. **Flexible PyPI**: Support both public and private PyPI
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Multiple test stages for quality

## 🐛 Known Considerations

### RHEL Runners
- If RHEL runners are not available, those jobs will be skipped
- Ubuntu jobs will still run and provide validation
- RHEL validation is optional but recommended for production

### FIPS Mode
- FIPS compliance checks are optional
- Requires `REQUIRE_FIPS` secret to be set
- Only relevant for environments requiring FIPS

### Private PyPI
- Private PyPI support is optional
- Requires secrets to be configured
- Falls back to public PyPI if not configured
