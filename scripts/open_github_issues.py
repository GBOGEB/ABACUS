The **Bridge Smoke Tests** workflow is failing with import errors.

## 📊 Workflow Details

- **Workflow:** Bridge Smoke Tests
- **Job:** Run bridge integration tests (smoke)
- **Status:** ❌ Failed

## 🐛 Error Details

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dmaic'
```

**Full traceback:**
```
ImportError while importing test module '/home/runner/work/ABACUS/ABACUS/DMAIC_V3/tests/test_bridge_integration.py'.
DMAIC_V3/core/handover_bridge.py:12: in <module>
    from dmaic import Idempotency, provenance, metrics as handover_metrics, recursion
E   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dmaic'
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

The test is trying to import `dmaic` module which is not installed or not in the Python path.

## 🔧 Proposed Fix

### Option 1: Add missing dependency
```python
# In DMAIC_V3/requirements.txt
dmaic>=1.0.0
```

### Option 2: Fix import path
```python
# In DMAIC_V3/core/handover_bridge.py
# Change:
from dmaic import Idempotency, provenance, metrics as handover_metrics, recursion

# To:
from DMAIC_V3.dmaic import Idempotency, provenance, metrics as handover_metrics, recursion
```

### Option 3: Install package in editable mode
```yaml
# In workflow file
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    pip install -e .
    pip install -r DMAIC_V3/requirements.txt
```

## 📋 Action Items

- [ ] Identify where `dmaic` module should come from
- [ ] Add to requirements.txt OR fix import paths
- [ ] Update `setup.py` if needed
- [ ] Test imports locally
- [ ] Re-run smoke tests

## 🔍 Root Cause

Compatibility issue between flake8 and newer versions of importlib-metadata on Python 3.12.

## 🔧 Proposed Fix

### Option 1: Pin importlib-metadata version
```python
# In DMAIC_V3/requirements.txt
importlib-metadata<5.0
```

### Option 2: Update flake8
```python
# In DMAIC_V3/requirements.txt
flake8>=7.0.0
```

### Option 3: Use ruff instead
```python
# In DMAIC_V3/requirements.txt
ruff>=0.1.0
```

## 📋 Action Items

- [ ] Update `requirements.txt` with compatible versions
- [ ] Test locally with Python 3.12
- [ ] Update workflow if needed
- [ ] Re-run checks
